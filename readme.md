# AAA Backpropagation Task

Group name: **AAAAA**

To run this code you need the python toolkit for userinterfaces installed. With manually installed versions of python this is usually already the case. If you installed python using homebrew tkinter is not added by default. This is easily solved by:

`brew install python-tk`
